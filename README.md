# Face Verification and Recognition with FaceNet

## Differentiate between face recognition and face verification
There are two categories for face recognition problems, including:
### 1- Face Verification:
Face Verification is related to validate a claimed identity based on the image of a face, and either accepting or rejecting the identity claim (one-to-one matching problem).

### 2- Face Recognition: 
Face Recognition has to be compared with all the registered persons to recognize who is this person (one-to-many matching problem).
